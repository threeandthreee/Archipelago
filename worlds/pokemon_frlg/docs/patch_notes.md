* New Option: Sevii Island Passes - Sets how the island passes are handled (vanilla, progressive, split, split + progressive)

* Oak will now give you the Mystic Ticket and Aurora Ticket check in the Hall of Fame after beating the Champion
* Vs. Seeker's capability has been restored, and you can now rematch trainers. Locations that require you to spend money now logically require a way to grind money

* Starting items are now placed directly into your bag at the start of the game instead of into your PC

* Unique items that are in your start inventory (Badges, HMs, Key Items, etc.) will be removed from the itempool

These are as follows: Pokémon Tower 7F - Mr. Fuji, Berry Forest - Lostelle, Lost Cave Room 10 - Selphy, Cinnabar Island Pokémon Center - Bill
* Adding to the last point. Bill at Cinnabar Island will no longer give the Tri Pass check. Talking to him at the Pokémon Center will take you to One Island. Celio will give you the Tri Pass check during your first meeting on One Island as in the vanilla game
