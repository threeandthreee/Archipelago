 Forgive me, Father, for

 We thought of asking for

[Edward]:[Golbez] attacked us
 with Baron's Red Wings.

[Cecil]:Listen!
 Possessing the crystal is
 an essential factor for
 our prosperity.
 Moreover, His Majesty
 judged that Mysidians
 know too much about the

 It seems he is nothing
 more than [Golbez]'s

 calling monsters.


 How sweet! Just like

[Kain]:No. There are

[Rosa]:I thought there
 were only four.
[Cid]:Then the rumor is

[Kain]:Right.
 The Dark Crystals![music #Sad2]

--- bank 1 message $10A ---

 Light and of open side,
 so to speak.
[Yang]:Then there are
 the hidden crystals!
[Cecil]:They are the Dark
 Crystals.
[Kain]:Right.
 Therefore, [Golbez] has
 only gathered half of
 all the crystals!
[Cid]:But the rumors do
 not say the whereabouts
 of the Dark Crystals.

[Kain]:[Golbez] knows.
[Cecil]:We must hurry then!
 Where is it, [Kain]?

[Kain]:Literally, the
 hidden side of the
 earth, the Underground.
[Yang]:Underground!?
[Cid]:How? Dig a hole?
[Kain]:Anyway, he said
 when all the crystals of
 Light and Darkness are
 gathered, the way to the
 moon opens.
[Cecil]:Way to the moon?

[Kain]:I guess so.
 And this is the clue to
 the secret, so he said.
 You should have it.

Did you see our boss
[Cid] anywhere?

--- map #BaronCastle message $0E ---
Boss! And you, [Cecil]!

--- map #BaronCastle message $0F ---
I'm sure our boss is doing
fine!

--- map #BaronCastle message $10 ---
I found a good place to
goof off and take a nap_


?! Oooops!
No! I'm just kidding!
Oh, please!
Don't tell our boss!

--- map #BaronCastle message $11 ---
Ghost!



Real?
Ah! Yes!
I am working hard, sir!

Don't you think I'm
getting better than my
boss?

Ooops! Don't tell boss!

Welcome to Toroia!

About the Crystal?
Then talk to the Clerics
inside the castle.

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $02 ---
Heard you brought back the
Crystal of Water from
Mysidia!

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $03 ---
All of [Golbez]'s soldiers
were not human.

_!?



I wasn't sleeping!

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $05 ---
Oh, King_

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $06 ---
[Kain]:Let's go, [Cecil].



 Outside the Castle is the
 city of Baron. Let's
 gather information and
 equipment in the city.

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $07 ---
[Cecil]!

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $08 ---
[Cecil]:What's wrong?
[Palom]:_It smells!
[Porom]:Like a monster!

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $09 ---
Baigan:Where?

--- map #BaronCastleLobby message $0A ---
[Palom]:See?
 Be careful, [Cecil]!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $00 ---
I feel something strange
about the King lately.

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $01 ---
Please take the throne!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $02 ---
I don't like Baigan!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $03 ---
What will we do without
our Red Wings_?

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $04 ---
I have faith in His
Majesty!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $05 ---
Please avenge the King!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $06 ---
The Misty Valley is in
the northwest.

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $07 ---
We, the Dragoons will
defend the castle!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $08 ---
If our Dragoon [Kain] and
[Cecil] of the Red Wings
join forces, there would
be no match!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $09 ---
I'm ashamed.

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $0A ---
If the King hears people
talk about him like this,
he'll be angry!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $0B ---
We'll post guard here!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $0C ---
[Kain]:Can't you sleep?
 Your room is at the top
 of the Left Tower.

 You'd better talk to
 all the people in this
 castle before going to
 the bed.

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $0D ---
[Cecil]:It's a surprise.
[Cid]:They obviously
 didn't understand!

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $0E ---
Treasure your life.

--- map #BaronCastleOuterCourt message $0F ---
I knew there was something
wrong about the King, but
I didn't want to lose my
life_

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $00 ---
King:[Cecil]! I'm happy
 you returned.
[Cecil]:Your Majesty_

King:I see you've become
 Paladin. But I do not
 like that. That's not
 good, [Cecil].
[Cecil]:_ King Baron?

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $01 ---
 You imposter!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $02 ---
[Cid]:You are gonna pay
 for putting me in that
 smelly joint!
 Wha_t?

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $03 ---
[Cecil]:[Cid]!
[Cid]:Oh! [Cecil]!
 Where is [Rosa]?
 She ran after you.
[Cecil]:[Golbez] took her_
[Cid]:[Golbez]_  abused my
 airship and now [Rosa]!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $04 ---
[Tellah]:We must rescue her.
 Lead us to the airship!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $05 ---
[Cid]:Who is this strange
 old man?
[Tellah]:What!?
 How about yourself?
[Cid]:I'm still young!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $06 ---
[Porom]:Oh, please stop.
 Mr. [Cid], this is
 Master [Tellah], a great
 sage.

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $07 ---
[Porom]:This is [Yang], the
 Karate Master of Fabul.
 And I'm [Porom]. A white
 wizard of Mysidia.

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $08 ---
[Palom]:Hi, guys!
[Porom]:That is my twin
 brother [Palom].
[Palom]:Yeah!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $09 ---
[Yang]:I am glad to meet
 you, sir.
[Cid]:Well! He knows some
 manners!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $0A ---
[Cecil]:Where is the latest
 airship?
[Cid]:Well!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $0B ---
Never again!
We sure will guard here!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $0C ---
[Cid]:Where nobody would
 suspect!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $0D ---
[Tellah]:We have no time!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $0E ---
[Cid]:Oh, be quiet and
 follow me!

--- map #BaronCastleThroneRoom message $0F ---

[Edward]:The SandRuby is
 made from the Antlion
 when it lays its eggs
 in the cave.
 The cave is in the east,
 but we must go across
 shallows to get there.
 
 There is the Hovercraft
 in Damcyan we can use.
 We can also go to Kaipo
 through the shallows!

 I'm just a coward.
 But I don't care. I'm
 staying here with [Anna].

[Cecil]:You're not the only
 one who is sad, [Edward].
 Besides, [Anna] won't be
 happy if you do that.
 We really need your help.
 Please come with us.


[Edward]:My help_?



[Cecil]:I am [Cecil]. I'm
 looking for the SandRuby
 to help my friend who is 
 ill in Kaipo.
 And I need your help!

[Cecil]:Yes. You.

 so much. A ship will be

 We hope it will help.

 Dark Knight who came to

 But it is still the arms
 of the dark side_

Dark Elf is weak against

Here's the crystal.
Now, be careful.

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $07 ---
Why are the crystals in
the hands of an evil one_!

Dark Elf is in a cave
on an island over in

What was that?

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $0A ---
They took it?
Then, get it back!

show it to us first, and
we promise to lend it to
you.

Please use our treasure
down in the basement.
We would like it to be
used for good.

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $0D ---
It's not that we lost the
crystal, but the problem
is that [Golbez] has it now!

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $0E ---
Metals get heavy in the
cave of the northwest!
Your swords and armors of
metal will be the same!

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $0F ---
We're only lending it to
you!

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $10 ---
Crystals were all kept
separately to avoid this
kind of situation. But_

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $11 ---
You cannot have it, but
if you can take it back,
you may use our Crystal of
Earth for a good purpose.

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $12 ---
What's that?

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $13 ---
One who has all the
crystals will acquire
the mightiest power.

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $14 ---
Crystal of Earth?
Dark Elf took it, and we
must take it back!
But_ how?

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $15 ---
Crystals increase the
powers of the one who hold
them. If he is evil, then
it will work for the evil!

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $16 ---
If the rumor is true that
there are more than four
crystals, we still have
some chances.

--- map #ToroiaCastleClericRoom message $17 ---
We the eight clerics rule
this country. We used to
have the blessing from the
Crystal of Earth. Not now.

happening!?

When you hear a new name,
you'd better note its
direction. Same as maps,
the upper part means north
and lower south.
Left means west, and to
the right is east.

When walking, only one
person will be shown.
You can select that person
by the R-Button.

To make a record of your
journey is called Save.
You can make a Save on the
field map or Save points
all around the world.

--- map #TrainingRoomMain message $03 ---
It is better to Save
before taking a rest or
going to unknown places.
Even if your party is
wiped out, you may
restart from the point
in which you Saved.

--- map #TrainingRoomMain message $04 ---
You can make a total of
4 Saves. You'd better make
more than 2 Saves, in case
a Save should be lost.
Specifying where to save
the data, your family can
enjoy the game in turn.

by talking to the man on

Do you know Chocobos?
They are ostrich-like
birds which can be used as
transportation.

--- map #TrainingRoomMain message $07 ---
They live in the round

You can catch and ride
Chocobos using A-Button
_just like talking!
While riding Chocobos,
you don't encounter
enemies.

--- map #TrainingRoomMain message $08 ---
You can't go inside of
places with Chocobos.
Get off first by pushing
A-Button.
Remember!
Chocobos will return to
their woods when freed.

--- map #TrainingRoomMain message $09 ---
When your items get too
many to carry, go to the
Big-Chocobos and leave
items in their care.
When it smells like
Chocobos, use Carrot.
Big-Chocobos will
surely appear!

in battles.
If you're not confident or

Recklessness, often proves
to be damaging. When you
are losing a battle, don't
hesitate to run away by
pushing L and R-Buttons
at the same time.

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $03 ---
You should move the people
with less HPs to the back
by using the Change
command. During the
battles, you can Change
the front and rear row by
pushing the left of the
Control Pad when in turn.
By pushing to right,
you can select Parry.

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $04 ---
There are spells which can
be used for all.
In the battles, you can
cast the spell on all
enemies by pushing the
Control Pad to left, and
all allies to right.

On Menu Screen, you can
cast spells to all by
pushing either left or
right.

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $05 ---

as items during battles.
You have to Equip them on

To change or supply new
weapons during battles,
select and change within

Be careful not to run out
of the arrows!
Bows won't, but arrows
will be gone when used!

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $07 ---
Don't keep running away
from your enemies!
You may drop some money
when escaping from them.

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $08 ---
You can equip weapons on
a certain hand. There are
some who can equip on both
hands though.

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $09 ---
Some monsters have their
weak points.
Monster of fire is weak
against coldness.
Monster of ice is weak
against fire, see?

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $0A ---
Monsters living in water
are weak against the
attacks of thunder.

--- map #TrainingRoomUpstairs message $0B ---

Lali!

[Cecil]:I'm sorry_
 [Golbez] took the crystal_


Giott:We must protect the
 last crystal then!


[Rosa]:Where is it?



Giott:In the Sealed Cave
 of northwest. But do not
 worry. The cave cannot be
 entered without the key.
[Cecil]:What should we do?
 [Golbez] is on his way!


Giott:So now is the chance
 for us to regain other
 crystals in the Tower of
 Bab-il!
[Kain]:What!?
[Yang]:Now [Golbez] is busy
 trying to get the last
 crystal, we_
Giott:We'll draw their
 attention with our tanks
 and you can sneak in.
 Now is the only chance!

--- map #DwarfCastleThroneRoom message $05 ---
[Kain]:What do we do?
[Rydia]:Isn't it their
 fortress?
[Rosa]:It's dangerous.
[Yang]:But we must do
 something now.
[Kain]:Now is the only
 chance we have.
[Cecil]:Okay_

--- map #DwarfCastleThroneRoom message $06 ---
[Cecil]:We'll do it!

 There is a path through

 Go whenever you're ready.
 Good luck!

 main forces of the enemy.
 You go to the Sealed Cave

 You hold the future of
 us all!

 Queen.

There is a village called
Tomra near the Sealed Cave
but we can't get there now
because of the lava!

fly, so we're counting on
you! Okay-Lali?

to the world of summoned
monsters!

You can't walk inside of

float! There is a magic to
float! Can you use it?

Titan, the King of Giants_
His power can crack the
earth and most foes will
be swallowed into it.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $03 ---
Jinn, the Burning Master_
His flame is said to
consume everything it
touches.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $04 ---
Legend tells us of the Art
of Summoning unbeknownst
to all_

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $05 ---
Indra is slow to anger_
But when he does, his
wrath will strike down
offenders with a terrible
lightning.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $06 ---
Shiva, the Queen of Ice_
Those who anger her will
be frozen to the bone.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $07 ---
Chocobo, is the best of
the summoned monsters_
as far as quickness of
flight and cuteness.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $08 ---
The Art of Summoning_
Now there are only a few
humans left alive to wield
this power.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $09 ---
The history of our land
traces back to the past
when humans did not exist_

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $0A ---
One must be strong in body
and mind to pass the cave
leading to the world of
humans.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary1F message $0B ---
All the summoned monsters
are illusionary in nature_
ferocious to the evil and
divine to the just.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $00 ---
Do you have literature in
the world of humans?

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $01 ---
There are countless books
here in this library. You
will never find it boring.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $02 ---
Callers_
Wizards with the power to
summon monsters of the
righteousness.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $03 ---
Summoned monsters, humans
and monsters_ From where
they came and where they
will go, we cannot know.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $04 ---
Long ago, a great whale
descended from the moon.
It is sleeping inside of
a dragon now.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $05 ---
Our true Master_
The King of the summoned
monsters created us. He
watches over us from afar.
The only way to beat him
is to reflect back his
power. So far, though,
no one has succeeded.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $06 ---
The two moons_
It is said only one moon
shone upon the primeval
earth.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $07 ---
Asura, our Queen_
She is the Queen of our
Master and the gateway to
his audience.
Those who beat her will be
able to see the true form
of our Master_

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $08 ---
Our Master_
Referred to by humans as
the Master of Oceans, he
is a ruler of might.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $09 ---
Odin, a knight with a
sharp blade_ He was beaten
only once when lightning
struck his sword.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $0A ---
Sylphs, the gentle, frail_
They can unite their power
together and unleash a
potent magic.

--- map #FeymarchLibrary2F message $0B ---
The Law_  True strength
lies in the just mind.
Test a Caller before you
answer the summon.

Elder:What do you want
 from us this time?


[Cecil]:I am [Cecil],
 the ex-captain of the Red
 Wings. I could not
 disobey the King.
Elder:Apologies will not
 bring our friends back
 alive. But I can at least
 listen to your words.
[Cecil]:I'm fighting the
 one called [Golbez] who is
 the mastermind of Baron.
 A girl was captured.
 So we were on our way to
 Baron for her rescue but
 we were attacked by
 Leviatan_ and_
Elder:Lost your friends.
 It would be your trial.
 But as long as you depend
 upon the Dark Sword, you
 cannot defeat true evil.
 Moreover, you might be
 consumed with its evil at
 any time.
 If you wish to fight
 against evil with good,
 go to Mt. Ordeals to
 the east of Mysidia.
[Cecil]:But I must hurry!
Elder:I do understand.
 But do not hurry.

 At first you must climb
 Mt. Ordeals and renounce
 this evil sword and gain
 the sword of sacredness.
 The one who can accept
 the holy light is called
 a Paladin. It is the
 sacred knight.
 Many went to Mt. Ordeals
 to be a Paladin, but none
 returned. Will you try?
[Cecil]:Yes!
Elder:But it would be hard
 for you alone with your
 Dark Sword.
 Take wizards with you.
 [Palom]! [Porom]!

--- bank 3 message $3A ---
Welcome!

--- bank 3 message $3B ---
[Cecil]:Who are you?



[Fusoya]:I am [Fusoya], the
 guardian of Lunarians'
 slumber.

[Rosa]:Lunarians?



[Fusoya]:Yes. Millenia ago,
 the planet between Mars
 and Jupiter was about to
 be shattered.
 The people who survived
 this calamity escaped by
 ships and headed for the
 Blue Planet.
[Cecil]:The Blue Planet?



[Fusoya]:Your land earth.
 However, the people of
 the earth were still in
 the process of evolution.
 Thus they created another
 Moon and kept sleeping.

--- bank 3 message $3C ---
[Edge]:Lunarians?
[Fusoya]:But he refused it.
 He tried to make the
 earth his place to live.
[Rydia]:Who?
[Fusoya]:I forced him to
 sleep. But his thoughts
 were still awaken.

--- bank 3 message $3D ---
[Cecil]:Is that who is
 controlling [Golbez]?
[Edge]:Who is that!?
[Fusoya]:He is Zemus.
 He needs the crystals as
 the energy source to
 reactivate the Tower of
 Bab-il.
 To bring down the Giant
 of Bab-il to annihilate
 the living on earth!

 Most of us Lunarians are
 waiting for you folks on
 the Blue Planet to be
 able to understand us.
[Cecil]:What about the
 Big Whale?


[Fusoya]:My brother KluYa
 made it to go to the Blue
 Planet.

 He taught your folks how
 to build the airships and
 the Serpent Road.

 KluYa fell in love with a
 girl of your Blue Planet
 and gave birth to two
 children. One of them is_
 _you, [Cecil].

--- bank 3 message $3E ---
Mechanics:Yes!

--- bank 3 message $3F ---
[Cecil]:Me!?



 Then the Light at
 the Mt. Ordeals was_


[Fusoya]:It must be the
 spirit of your father
 KluYa.

[Cecil]:My father_
 is that Light_


[Fusoya]:KluYa gave you his
 power to thwart the foul
 machination of Zemus.

 We must stop him for the
 sake of our two races!
 Now let's hurry to the
 Tower of Bab-il in Eblan!
[Edge]:Tower of Bab-il!?
 But it's shielded!

--- bank 3 message $40 ---
[Fusoya]:I can neutralize
 the shield!
 I will go with you!

Lunarian [Fusoya] joined![music #CharacterJoined][pause 40]

[Kain]:But Zeromus' last
 words_

--- bank 3 message $42 ---
[Rosa]:As long as there is
 evil in the hearts of
 people_

[Fusoya]:Evil in our minds
 will never disappear_
 We all have both evil and
 good in our mind,
 just as there are the
 crystals of Light and
 Darkness, the ground and
 underground.
 But as long as the evil
 exists, so does good.
 Just as you held good in
 your heart to fight evil.

 you instead!
