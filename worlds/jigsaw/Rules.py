class PuzzleBoard:
    """
    Puzzle board implementation.

    Optimized for efficiently adding pieces to the board and calculating the number of new merges that would be made
    when adding a piece.

    A board stores a cluster ID value for each piece placed on the board, where `None` indicates an empty space on the
    board.
    _0____3_
    ____4_3_
    __1_____
    __1_22__

    Piece placement behaviours:
    A)
    A newly placed piece that does not connect to any existing placed pieces is given a new unique cluster ID and is
    added to a new cluster that is given that ID.
    _0____3_
    ____4_3_
    __1_____
    __1_22_5 <--

    B)
    A newly placed piece that connects to only a single piece gains the cluster ID of the connecting piece.
    _0____3_
    ____4_33 <--
    __1_____
    __1_22_5

    C)
    When a piece is placed that would connect to multiple existing clusters of pieces, the largest of the clusters is
    found and all pieces in the smaller clusters are added into the largest cluster.
    The cluster IDs of the smaller clusters are then returned to the board's list of unique cluster IDs, to be re-used
    later on for new clusters.
