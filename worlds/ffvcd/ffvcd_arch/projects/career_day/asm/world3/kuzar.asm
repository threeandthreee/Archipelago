; the below hacks are postponed
; there's weirdness with these needing to be in the exact position, where even padding messes them up big time





; If you want to replace these you need to:
; 1) Hack the text dynamically for 12 Kuzar in bank $E1 for these randomized items
; 2) Put the standard $DE, $xx code in
; 3) You can possibly ignore the $DF command because the player already knows the item from above, which will give you perfect space. Otherwise youll bleed too many commands 
; 4) If you do want it all, then you can cut out the $C7, $03 simultaneous.
