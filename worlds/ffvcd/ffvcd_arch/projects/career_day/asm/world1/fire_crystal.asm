; This cutscene is a real doozy, I'll do my best to explain it here.
; The first section of this patch removes the whole "pre-falling down"
; portion of the event. The second part of this patch is what retains
; the state of the room when you walk back UP into the crystal room
; from the downstairs room.

; This is where all the important flags are set, these are largely the fires
; in the castle proper, but also relocks many doors and sets some chests. This
; event is largely "normal" as far as strategy to hack an event is concerened.
; In fact, as long as this hack is run before the second one, you don't even have
; to be as precise with the padding as I have been (the second patch will overwrite the 00s)

; This is the weird part. This patch MUST have the "Inter Map Cutscene" (db $E3, $91, $00, $8F, $10, $00)
; written at $C87EEF. This is because when you walk back up from the room
; with the healing pot in it, you aren't actually travelling rooms. There's an event
; right in the stairwell and it points to that address, $C87EEF. I left this entire
; portion in tact, as it's a bit unclear to me why all the sprite movement is ocurring.
; The map tile calls are all setting the room back up like you'd expect after the crystal exploded.

;To reiterate, if you change this, LEAVE db $E3, $91, $00, $8F, $10, $00 AT $C87EEF
