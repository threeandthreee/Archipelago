# Cat Quest Multiworld Setup Guide

## Required Software

- Cat Quest from: [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/593280/Cat_Quest/)
    - Other store platforms have not been tested but should work.
- BepInEx from: [GitHub](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
- Cat Quest Randomizer from: [GitHub](https://github.com/Nikkilites/CatQuest-Randomizer/releases)
- Cat Quest World from: [GitHub](https://github.com/Nikkilites/Archipelago-CatQuest/releases)

## Installation

1. Download and install BepInEx 5 (x86, version 5.4.20 or newer) into your Cat Quest root folder.

2. Start Cat Quest once, so that BepInEx can create its required configuration files.

3. After BepInEx has been installed and configured, download the Cat Quest Randomizer and unpack the files into the root folder. 

## Connecting

You connect by opening `...\ArchipelagoRandomizer\SaveData\RoomInfo.json` from your Cat Quest root folder, and adding your player and room information.
It should follow the format that the file already has. Then the connection should be established once you start your save. 

You start a new game by picking New Game in your menu. If you already beat the game and only have New Game +. choose this, and then pick New Game within that menu
(Do not play using Mew Game or New Game +)
You continue your game by clicking Continue like in vanilla Cat Quest.
