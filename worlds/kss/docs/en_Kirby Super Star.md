# Kirby Super Star

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
### All Subgames
- Access to a subgame will be blocked until the subgame is received from the multiworld.
- Kirby will be unable to absorb copy abilities from enemies until the respective ability has been received from the multiworld.

### Dyna Blade
- Stage progression is locked by receiving `Progressive Stage` from the multiworld.
- Access to each of the EX stages is locked by the multiworld.

### The Great Cave Offensive
- Access to each subsection of The Great Cave is blocked behind collecting a certain amount of treasure, based on the value of each treasure.

### Milky Way Wishes
- Access to each planet within the galaxy is locked by receiving them from the multiworld. 
- Each player is given a single planet to begin with. This can be the `???` planet.

## What is considered a location check in Kirby Super Star?
- Defeating most major bosses/completing stages in each subgame
- Winning the race in each round of Gourmet Race

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A sound effect will play, and Kirby will immediately receive the effects of that item, such as being able to receive Copy Abilities from enemies that 
give said Copy Ability. Receiving a subgame will require you to refresh the corkboard screen (ie. enter a subgame's title screen then back out) before applying.
