# EarthBound

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Randomization of EarthBound randomizes all items, from presents, PSI Locations, Character Locations, and gifts from NPCs.

## What is the goal of EarthBound when randomized?
By default, the goal is to reach the defined number of Sanctuaries, and then defeat Giygas at the Cave of the Past.
If Giygas is disabled, the game will end once the player reaches the required sanctuary number.
If Magicant is set to "required", players will need to defeat Ness's Nightmare in Magicant, unlocked upon reaching their required
Sanctuaries, before they can win.
Optionally, the player can set Alternate Goal conditions, on 1 or 2 sanctuaries more than required, but these will never be the expected
goal.


## What items and locations get shuffled?

Locations consist of PSI Locations, Character Locations, presents, and gifts from NPCs.

PSI Locations are locations tied to psychic events in the normal game, usually corresponding to the Sanctuaries, PSI Teleport, or PSI Starstorm.
By default, PSI locations will always contain either a Teleport Destination, or a progressive upgrade for PSI Starstorm. These can be optionally placed
in the Multiworld pool.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in EarthBound?

When receiving an item for another player, the game will identify it as the item, and it will report that the receiving player, as opposed to the player's party, received the item.
Items do not have a visual appearance.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
When receiving an item, a fanfare will be heard. If this item is a Teleport destination, they will instead hear a PSI fanfare. If the item is a character,
that character's introductory speech will play, followed by them joining the party. If the player receives an item and all of their inventory slots are full,
the item will automatically be sent to storage with Escargot Express. If storage is full, no items will be received until space is made.


## My inventory is full and there's items I can't find!
You can press R at any time on the overworld to access a pocket storage menu that allows you to store, withdraw from storage, and toss unnessecary items within one menu.
