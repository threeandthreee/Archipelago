### Ship issue
And a very strange issue with the ship that happened to two of us, where it seemed to contort and stretch its geometry at random (which is something Iâ€™ve never seen before)

### Deathlink issues
- deathlinks received while traveling to a planet cause a crash when landing. Related to ship issue maybe. (test fix)
- Some insta death situations like drowning don't trigger death link
- Receiver bot section probably shouldn't trigger death links.

### Logic Fixes

### Misc Issues
- Warped to Slim's Shack using button shortcut from Tabora (room with wrench upgrade), and game unlocked "Nice Ride" skill point whereas I was far from having all ship upgrades
- Remove most cutscenes, whenever possible
- Investigate Grelbin bridge extend conditions.
- Deal the taxi spawn conditions the Hypnotist on Damosel.
- Prevent default popups when checking hypnomatic part locations
- Some/All Hypnomatic Part locations may still give their original items.
- Megacorp Scientist broken **if Shop route is completed first**
