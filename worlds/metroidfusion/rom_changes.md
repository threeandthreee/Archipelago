## Changes from vanilla

- Events, bosses, etc. can now be done out of order, like you'd expect is required for randomization.
- Missiles, beams, and suit upgrades have been split.
- Screw Attack doesn't allow single wall jumps. You'd never encounter this in vanilla without hacking, but it's a fun fact.
- Pickups have been added to multiple locations:
- - Saving the animals
- - Auxiliary Power Station
- - Sub-Zero Containment
- - Quarantine Bay
- - Northeast Atmospheric Stabilizer
- - Cooling the main boiler
- The goal is to acquire a number of Infant Metroids, defeat the SA-X on the Operations Deck, reach the Operations Room to set the self-destruct, and escape.
- - Reaching the Operations Room requires Hi-Jump or Space Jump.
- - Defeating the SA-X requires Charge Beam and Missiles.
- - The level 4 keycard is not required for the Operations Room.
- - The Main Deck music will change to its endgame version when these requirements are fulfilled.
- Room layouts have been changed to facilitate better randomization.
- The western side of Sector 5 is always in its pre-Nightmare state, with changes to facilitate acquiring items and traversing to the Nightmare area.
- You can now enable/disable power ups in the pause menu.
- Rooms have been given names (credit goes to the Randovania team). Your current room name can be seen by pressing A on the map screen.
- You can warp to your starting location by pressing L on the map screen. Ingame progress since your last save will be lost.
- The client will sync received items and pickups with the server, allowing you to keep obtained items after game over/resetting/warping to start.
