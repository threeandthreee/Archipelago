# A Link Between Worlds

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items in the game have their locations moved around. Optionally, the prizes at the end of dungeons may be shuffled amongst themselves, and weather vanes and cracks between worlds may have their destinations randomized.

## What is the goal of the game?

You must defeat dungeon bosses to rescue the required number of sages (by default all 7), then defeat Yuganon.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Items that are shuffled include all key items, heart pieces, dungeon items, rupees, and monster parts. These items may be obtained from chests, freestanding items, or NPCs. Optionally, Maiamai may be included in the randomized item pool, and Maiamai locations may have randomized items. Another optional setting creates an additional item called Quake which is necessary to open all the cracks except the one in Hyrule Castle.

## What does another world's item look like?

All items for other worlds look like the Letter in a Bottle. Check the client to determine what item you have actually sent.

## What happens when the player receives an item?

An item popup appears as if you had collected the item yourself.

## How does this differ from the standalone randomizer?

The Archipelago randomizer is based on the 0.4.0 beta of the [standalone randomizer](https://github.com/rickfay/z17-randomizer/) by Rick Fay and Kevin Marsolais. However, some features have not yet been implemented. This includes Mother Maiamai location checks, the Crack Shuffle option, the Chest Size Matches Contents option, and Hint Ghosts. Also, some minor changes have been made to the logic: heart requirements for dungeons are removed, compass requirements for certain dungeon locations are also removed, and the Great Rupee Fairy check now logically requires the ability to complete Treacherous Tower for rupee farming.
