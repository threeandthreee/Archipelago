      Hello <player>.
      I am returning
      your call.
    - |
      You're concerned
      about the tracker
      being incorrect?

      I have spoken

      the tracker is
      right. It's never

      To be fair, you
      have to have a
      very high IQ to
    - |
      understand
      mischief.
    - |
      The humour is ex-
      tremely subtle,
      and without a
    - |
      solid grasp of
      game mechanics
      most of the jokes
    - |
      will go over a
      typical player's
      head.

      Picture this,
      <player>: a true
      Crystal sequel.
    - |
      Vast new routes.
      Wilder stories.
      Endless choice.
    - |
      Or at least, the
      illusion of such
      things, of course.
    - |
      You could skip
      badges entirely.
      Or not at all.
    - |
      LEGENDS may flee,
      refusing capture,
      mocking you.
    - |
      Rivals could stay,
      or vanish before
      you even care.
    - |
      And then-ah yes!
      The grand idea!
      A jump button!
    - |
      Imagine it now:
      <player> leaping
      joyfully upward.
    - |
      Except, no, that's
      dreadful. <POKE>MON
      don't jump.
    - |
      Well, perhaps they
      do, but not you.
      Not like that.
    - |
      Still, wouldn't a
      Crystal sequel be
      magnificent?
    - |
      Or terrible. Or
      worse: ordinary.
    - |
      Yes, ordinary is
      far worse than
      dreadful.
    - |
      And so <player>,
      this sequel will
      never exist.
    - |
      Which of course,
      makes it the most
      perfect sequel.
