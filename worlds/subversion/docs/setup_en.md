# Super Metroid Subversion Setup Guide

## Required Software and Installation Procedures

Installation for this game is the same as Super Metroid. If you've already followed the instructions for Super Metroid, you're ready to go!

## Create a Config (.yaml) File

### What is a config file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a config file?

The Player Settings page on the website allows you to configure your personal settings and export a config file from
them. Player settings page: [Super Metroid Subversion Player Settings Page](/games/Subversion/player-settings)

### Verifying your config file

If you would like to validate your config file to make sure it works, you may do so on the YAML Validator page. YAML
validator page: [YAML Validation page](/mysterycheck)

## Generating a Single-Player Game

1. Navigate to the Player Settings page, configure your options, and click the "Generate Game" button.
    - Player Settings page: [Super Metroid Subversion Player Settings Page](/games/Subversion/player-settings)
2. You will be presented with a "Seed Info" page.
3. Click the "Create New Room" link.
4. You will be presented with a server page, from which you can download your patch file.
5. Double-click on your patch file, and the Subversion Client will launch automatically, create your ROM from the
   patch file, and open your emulator for you.
6. Since this is a single-player game, you will no longer need the client, so feel free to close it.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Obtain your patch file and create your ROM

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your config file to whoever is hosting. Once that is done,
the host will provide you with either a link to download your patch file, or with a zip file containing everyone's patch
files. Your patch file should have a `.apsv` extension.

Put your patch file on your desktop or somewhere convenient, and double click it. This should automatically launch the
client, and will also create your ROM in the same place as your patch file.

### Connect to the client

Connecting is the same as with Super Metroid.
