# This module adds logic to the apworld.
# In short, we ran a simulation for every possible combination of dice and rolls you can have, per category.
# This simulation has a good strategy for locking dice.
# This gives rise to an approximate discrete distribution per category.
# We calculate the distribution of the total score.
# We then pick a correct percentile to reflect the correct score that should be in logic.
# The score is logic is *much* lower than the actual maximum reachable score.
