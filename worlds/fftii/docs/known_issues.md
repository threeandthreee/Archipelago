# Known Issues

Anything in this list is a known issue and is either due to be fixed at a later date or won't be fixed
due to the high difficulty to fix and low impact to the player.

- When moving Ramza on the overworld, if your destination is more than sixteen spaces away, he won't move.
- - This can be worked around by just moving him in multiple separate steps.
- When learning abilities from crystals, what abilities you have access to learn are based off of
vanilla job unlock requirements, not which jobs you've been sent through the multiworld.
- Units in some battle events may behave strangely such as facing the wrong direction or displaying
an incorrect sprite. These do not affect gameplay.
- When receiving inventory items while in the formation screen, you have to re-sort your inventory or
re-enter the formation screen for new items to be equippable.
