## Preface
This reference lists every monster and a location they can be found. This list is not exhaustive; rather, it's the
locations used for the internal logic of the APWorld on if a monster is accessible. The locations provided are
intended to be those with the fewest requirements to reach, not necessarily the easiest fights or most common spawns.

The number following the battlefield is the formation number for that direction. Formation 1 is available from the
beginning of the game. Formation 2 requires two **Progressive Shop Levels** to be obtained, Formation 3 requires five,
and Formation 4 as well as the Rare battle require eight.
