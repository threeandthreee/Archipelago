## Changes from vanilla

- The world map is no longer unlocked through linear story progression.
- - Instead, regional passes must be acquired to unlock the locations in those regions
- - The regions are Gallione (where you start by default), Fovoham, Lesalia, Lionel, Zeltennia, Limberry, and Murond.
- Story and sidequest battles are now accessed through pressing R2 while on their associated location dot.
- Randomly occuring battles no longer happen.
- - Instead, they are accessed by holding Circle while traveling to their location dot.
- Character recruitments and Ramza job upgrades are accessed by pressing L2 while on a location dot.
- The goal of the game is still to travel to Murond Death City and defeat Altima. 
- - However, in order to unlock the way there, a number of Zodiac Stones must be acquired first from the multiworld.
- Character recruitments, shop inventory unlocks, jobs, and Ramza's unique Squire job are unlocked as multiworld items.
- Characters are recruited with no equipment and in their base job at job level 2.
- - However, they will receive the benefit of JP Boon items obtained prior to their recruitment.
- The Deep Dungeon is fully lit.
- Rafa and Malak's unique abilities now can hit up to ten times (like in the War of the Lions 
and Ivalice Chronicles versions).
- Cloud can use Limit with any sword, not just the Materia Blade.
- You can fast forward through event text by holding X.
