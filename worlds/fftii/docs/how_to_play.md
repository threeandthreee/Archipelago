## Concepts

### Introduction
_Final Fantasy Tactics Ivalice Island_ is an open world randomizer mod for Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS1, developed 
specifically for Archipelago. Your goal is to collect enough **Zodiac Stones** to open the way to Murond Death City and
defeat Altima in the Graveyard of Airships. You will begin the game in Gallione, at Gariland. As you play, you will
unlock various **Pass** items that will open the paths to the other regions of Ivalice. Completing story battles and other
goals will unlock items and upgrades to aid you in your journey.

### Controls
On the world map, there are a few special controls used to interface with the changes made for Ivalice Island.

- Press `R2` to load into a menu for your current location that will allow you to select an event battle at that location
to engage in. For example, pressing R2 when at Dorter Trade City will load a menu allowing you to select the Dorter Slums
battle from Chapter 1 or the Dorter City battle from Chapter 2.
- Press `L2` to process any received character recruitments and Ramza job form upgrades.
- When traveling on the world map, hold `O` to engage in a random battle at your destination.

### Goal
The objective of Ivalice Island is to collect enough **Zodiac Stones** to unlock the route to Murond Death City. 
Once enough are collected, the route to Murond Death City will appear connecting from the Deep Dungeon.

### Zodiac Stones
Depending on your options, up to thirteen Zodiac Stones can be in the item pool, and up to thirteen can be required to
unlock Murond Death City. Aside from unlocking the route there, Zodiac Stones have no effect.

### Passes
In order to access locations beyond Gallione, Passes are required. For example, to access the region of Fovoham, the 
**Fovoham Pass** is required, and to access the region of Lesalia, the **Lesalia Pass** is required.
 
Simply having a **Pass** isn't necessarily enough. For some regions, you will also need the **Pass** for adjoining 
regions. For example, traveling to Lionel requires the **Lionel Pass**, of course, but you will also need the 
**Lesalia Pass** or **Murond Pass** as those regions lie between Gallione and Lionel.

A full list of what locations belong to what regions can be found in the [References document](./references.md).

### Jobs
If enabled in your options, jobs will be items you can acquire and meeting the requirements to unlock a job will be
a location that provides an item. Once acquired, a job is unlocked for all units immediately. You will always begin
the game with the Squire job unlocked.

As Squire and Chemist have no requirements to unlock, you will receive the items at those locations immediately upon
beginning the game.

### Shop inventory
At the start of the game, you begin with a limited shop inventory, just like in the vanilla game. Obtaining 
**Progressive Shop Unlock** items will unlock more items in the various stores of Ivalice.

Additionally, receiving more **Progressive Shop Unlock** items will unlock more random battle formations at each
battlefield.

### Character Recruitments
All sixteen unique characters (both forms of Reis are included) are included as items in the item pool. Characters may
be dismissed, but if they are, they cannot be reacquired.

### Ramza's Squire Job
Ramza begins the game in his Chapter 1 Squire job. Obtaining **Progressive Ramza Job Form** items will progress his job to
their Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 forms.

### Filler Items
Filler items not belonging to the above categories will be included. These can be normal shop items, rare unbuyable
items, bonus gil items, and bonuses of spendable JP for all units in your roster.

## Options

### Zodiac Stones
The **Zodiac Stones** required to reach Murond Death City can be customized. The amount in the pool and amount
required can be adjusted between one and thirteen each. If the number required is more than the number in the pool, 
additional **Zodiac Stones** will be added to the pool to make up the difference.

**Zodiac Stone** placement can also be customized. 

- On the *Vanilla Stones* setting, eight story locations and three sidequest locations (if enabled) that hold 
**Zodiac Stones** in the vanilla game will be eligible to have a **Zodiac Stone** (see the 
[References document](./references.md)). If the number of **Zodiac Stones** in the settings are greater than the 
number of locations available, the number of **Zodiac Stones** in the pool will be reduced to match.
- On the *Anywhere Local* setting, **Zodiac Stones** can be on any location in your own world.
- On the *Anywhere* settings, **Zodiac Stones** can be anywhere in the multiworld.

### Final Battles
The finale at Murond Death City can be customized. On the *Vanilla* setting, the six final battles of the game must
be completed in order to clear the game: Underground Book Storage 4, Underground Book Storage 5, Murond Death City,
Lost Sacred Precincts, Graveyard of Airships 1, Graveyard of Airships 2. On the *Altima Only* setting, only the 
Graveyard of Airships 2 fight against Altima must be completed. The other five fights are relocated to Orbonne 
Monastery.

### Job Unlocks
If enabled, jobs and job unlocks will be items and locations in the multiworld. You will begin the game with just the
**Squire** job unlocked. Meeting the requirements for a unit to unlock a job will instead send a location check. For
example, reaching Squire level 2 will send the items for **Knight Unlock** and **Archer Unlock**. Receiving a job
from the multiworld will unlock that job for all units.

If disabled, jobs will be unlocked as they normally are in the vanilla game.

### Rare Battles
If enabled, the rare battle formation for every battlefield will be a location check. While in the vanilla game these
would appear randomly from one particular direction, in _Ivalice Island_ these are accessed from the same menu
story battles are found in once eight **Progressive Shop Level** items have been acquired.

If disabled, these battles will still be accessible but will not provide a multiworld item.

### Poach Locations
If enabled, poaching monsters with the Support ability Secret Hunt will be location checks. Depending on what Passes 
have been obtained, recruiting a monster with the Action ability Invitation or the Support ability Train and
then hatching another of the same family can be required.

If disabled, poaching monsters will not provide a multiworld item.

Regardless of the setting chosen, a monster's normal Poach rewards will be available from Fur Shops.

### Logical Difficulty
This setting affects the placement of job items (when Job Unlocks are enabled) and **Progressive Shop Level** items.
A certain number of each are logically required for battles as you progress through the game, ensuring you have a 
minimum amount of options before being required to take on a fight. Higher difficulties will logically require fewer
**Progressive Shop Level** items and job items, with Extreme requiring none at all: player beware!

### Filler Item Weights
These options adjust the weighting of filler items in the multiworld item pool. Setting a category to a weight of zero
will ensure it does not appear in the item pool, unless all categories are set to zero, in which case an even amount of
each will be chosen.
