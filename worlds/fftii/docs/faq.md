# Final Fantasy Tactics Ivalice Island FAQ

## What is this?

Final Fantasy Tactics Ivalice Island is an open world randomizer for Final Fantasy Tactics for the PS1, 
designed from the ground up for Archipelago.

## What does "open world" mean here?

You begin the game in Gariland, just like in vanilla. 
However, you may proceed to any location in the Gallione region in whatever order you choose. 
Unlocking various Pass items for other regions will open up travel to those regions, providing more locations to visit. 
Story battles may be accessed in any order, with each one providing items upon completion.

The goal of the game is to collect enough Zodiac Stones to unlock the way to Murond Death City and defeat Altima.

## What are the differences from the vanilla game?

- World map paths are unlocked through acquiring Pass items for each region 
(Gallione, Fovoham, Lesalia, Lionel, Zeltennia, Limberry, Murond).
- The Zodiac Stones are required in order to access the final series of fights at Murond Death City.
- Shop inventory is no longer tied to specific events in the story, and is instead added to as you collect specific items.
- Ramza's unique Squire job no longer progresses with specific events, and is instead upgraded as you collect specific items.
- Guests no longer join your party, and instead will have fixed levels and equipment in the battles they participate in.
- Characters no longer join after specific battles in the story, and instead are found as items.
- Random battle formations for each battlefield are unlocked in a uniform timing with shop inventory progress.
- Optionally, the following changes can be done:
- - You begin the game with just Squire unlocked, and must unlock the other jobs as items.
- - The "rare" special battle in each battlefield can give an item reward.
- - Poaching each monster type can give an additional item reward on top of the Fur Shop reward.
- - Sidequest battles and recruitments can give an item reward.

## What Quality of Life options have been added?

- JP Boon items have been added, adding JP to your character's jobs to make acquiring abilities easier
- JP gains have been multiplied across the board (configurable with an option) to make unlocking new jobs easier.

## Where can the Zodiac Stones be on the Vanilla Stones setting?

- Inside of Lionel Castle
- Slums of Goug
- Inside Riovanes Castle
- Roof of Riovanes Castle
- Bethla Garrison Sluice
- Inside Limberry Castle
- Limberry Castle Cemetary
- Igros Castle
- Graveyard of Airships 1 (only when Altima Only is enabled)
- Goland Underground Passage (only when sidequests are enabled)
- Nelveska Temple (only when sidequests are enabled)
- END (only when sidequests are enabled)

Because in vanilla the Limberry Castle Cemetary gives out two stones (one from Zalera and one from Meliadoul),
Inside Limberry Castle was chosen as a possible location for a Zodiac Stone to maintain some parity with vanilla.

## Can I play this single player?

Yes, though a server connection is still required, as most items are given by the client.
