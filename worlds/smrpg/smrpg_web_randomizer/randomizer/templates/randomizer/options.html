            <h3 class="card-title">Mechanical changes to Super Mario RPG</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4>File Select Changes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The character that appears on the file select screen is randomized.</li>
                <li>The names of the four save slots are randomized (no longer MARIO1, MARIO2, etc).</li>
                <li>The combination of the character and save slot names serves as a verification hash value to
                    confirm that racers all have the same seed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>General Gameplay Changes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Mario is now swappable with other characters in the party.</li>
                <li>The maximum number of coins you can hold is increased to 9999.  Item prices in shops can also go
                    above 999 as a result of this.
                </li>
                <li>The Seed, Fertilizer, and Bright Card items are now Special Items that cannot be sold and do not
                    take up normal inventory space.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cutscene Skip</h4>
            <p>The randomizer applies a patch which skips most of the cutscenes and text in the game. This patch
                only works on the US or EU version, since the EU version is based on the US one. Only these regions
                are supported as a result.</p>
            <h4>Equipment & Psychopath</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Equipment descriptions as seen in game menus will explain what the equipment piece does. <a href="{% url 'randomizer:guide' %}#equipment">Here is an explanation on the symbols used to describe stats and buffs.</a></li>
            <li>The Psychopath spell, when <a target="_blank" href="http://pidgezero.one/timings/index.html#Psychopath">properly timed</a>, will explain elements the enemy is weak to, elements it is immune to, and status effects that it is weak to. <a href="{% url 'randomizer:guide' %}#spells-yours">Here is an explanation on the symbols used.</a></li>

            <h3 class="card-title">Progression Modes</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <h4>Open</h4>
            <p>The primary open world mode of this randomizer!  Open mode significantly changes the base game in a
                number of ways.  In general, this is a non-linear mode
                where almost the entire map is open to you from the beginning.  You must recover the star pieces (in any
                order) to open the way to the Factory and the endgame.  This means you can go into high level areas at a
                comparitively low level, so save often!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first star pieces must be collected in order to open the path to Bowser's Keep/Factory.</li>
                <li>Those star pieces may not be on their vanilla bosses, depending on the flags used.</li>
                <li>Smithy must still be defeated to finish the game as normal.</li>
                <li>Dying to any of the bosses in Bowser's Keep after the doors (Magikoopa, Boomer, Exor) will return
                    you to Mario's Pad like the beginning of the game.  This is to avoid the situation where the player
                    goes through Bowser's Keep but is unable to defeat the bosses at the end to progress.  If you wish
                    to retry a boss fight, you can reset to the save point manually.
                </li>
                <li>It is now possible to save in between the Boomer and Exor fights in Bowser's Keep.  After defeating
                    Boomer, you are returned to the entrance of the throne room.  Approaching the throne a second time
                    will begin the Exor fight.
                </li>
                <li>After defeating Exor, you will be placed back in the throne room instead of being transported to the
                    factory.  You can leave the keep by entering the statue mouth behind the throne.
                </li>
                <li>Melody Bay songs 2 and 3 are unlocked by clearing the Moleville Mountain minecart ride and defeating
                    Belome 2 respectively.  Song 1 is available to be played from the start.
                </li>
                <li>Melody Bay songs must still be played in order to get the items at those spots!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Linear</h4>
            <p>The legacy mode from the original version of the randomizer. In Linear mode, while the most of the
                cutscenes and text have been removed, the actual progression
                of the plot and collection of the star pieces remains the same as the vanilla game. Story events will
                occur where they are supposed to, characters will join your party at the expected points (although which
                character it is can be randomized if desired), and stars will be awarded from the same bosses.
            </p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a <strong>LEGACY</strong> mode!  Many flags are unavailable in this mode,
                and new features are <strong>NOT</strong> being added to this as a general rule!  It is significantly
                different from the main open world mode, and has only been kept intact to preserve some of the
                experience of the original version of the randomizer made by abyssonym.
