    <h1>What is the Super Mario RPG Open World Randomizer?</h1>
    <div class="card card-body bg-light border my-2">
        <p>A program that shuffles around a bunch of stuff in Super Mario RPG! The world looks the same, the game's
            objective is the same, but plenty of things can get shuffled around &mdash; such as playable characters, monsters,
            progression items, shop items, character/equipment/monster stats, and even Star Pieces! It's a different
            experience every time!</p>
        <p>This new version is an <strong>open world</strong> randomizer, inspired by other works such as the
            <a href="http://ff4fe.com" target="_blank">FF4: Free Enterprise</a> randomizer.  This means most of the map
            is open from the start which drastically changes the gameplay!

    <h1>Just who is responsible for this thing?</h1>
    <div class="card card-body bg-light border my-2">
        <p>This program wouldn't have been possible without the work of several people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abyssonym" target="_blank">abyssonym</a> for making the
                original command line version of the randomizer up to V4 and allowing us to adapt it into this new form!
                While it has evolved far beyond his original version, this would not have been possible without his work
                in the first place.  Check out his GitHub page for more randomizer work!
            </li>
            <li>Huge thanks to Alanim for all of the primary ROM hacking!  This new version would not be possible
                without him!
            </li>
            <li>This new web version was written and is maintained by
                <a href="https://github.com/DorkmasterFlek" target="_blank">Dorkmaster Flek</a>.
            </li>

                <a href="http://ff4fe.com" target="_blank">FF4: Free Enterprise</a> community which we totally stole a
                bunch of good ideas from!
