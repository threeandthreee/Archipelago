        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>An emulator is a program that closely replicates SNES hardware, allowing you to run SNES games on
                your computer.</p>
            <p>While you can play using only your keyboard, a controller makes for a better experience. While most
                USB controllers will work, the most recommended ones include the
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B9XB0E" target="_blank">iBuffalo Classic USB Gamepad</a> or
                the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y0LUQFE" target="_blank">8Bitdo SFC30 Wireless Bluetooth
                    Controller</a>.</p>
            <p>Some emulators available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.snes9x.com" target="_blank">Snes9x</a> <strong>*MOST RECOMMENDED*</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Very popular, widely considered the overall best SNES emulator.</li>
                        <li>Generally the easiest to set up and use compared to others.</li>
                        <li>Use version <strong>1.56 or later only</strong>! Anything prior to version 1.56 does not
                            emulate the SA-1 chip properly. Get the latest stable version for best results.
                        </li>

                        <li>Very accurate, and supports multiple systems.</li>
                        <li>More complicated to set up, and requires a more powerful CPU.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Frontend for libretro library, supports many different systems.</li>
                        <li>Snes9x cores are based on older versions, <strong>does not work</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Has bsnes cores which should be okay for compatibility, use these instead.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Snes9x core based on the older Snes9x version 1.54.
                            <strong>Does not work with SMRPG.</strong></li>
                        <li>bsnes core based on v87 of bsnes compatibility mode (heavily modified).
                            <strong>Only option that works with SMRPG.</strong></li>
                        <li>In general, this emulator is not recommended unless you specifically need the advanced
                            features it provides for something like a TAS.</li>

                        <li>ZSNES is no longer under active development and has a long history of accuracy problems with
                            its emulation.

            <h3 class="card-title">Option 2: Play on Original Hardware</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Yes, you read that right! You can actually play this on your original SNES console now. Playing a
                randomizer on original hardware requires a "flash cart", which is a special cartridge designed for that
                hardware that allows you to put the randomized ROM on some kind of portable flash memory (usually an SD
                or MicroSD card) which is inserted into the flash cart, which then goes in the original console.</p>
            <p>The best SNES flash cart on the market right now (and the only one that currently supports Super Mario
                RPG) is the SD2SNES.  You can learn more about it, download the firmware, and find a shop to buy one on
                their website <a href="https://sd2snes.de/blog/about" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Until very recently, no SNES flash cart on the market supported the SA-1 enhancement chip that SMRPG
                uses.  However thanks to the insane work of
                <a href="https://github.com/RedGuyyyy/" target="_blank">RedGuy</a>, SA-1 support has been added to the
                latest SD2SNES firmware!</p>
            <p><strong>Make sure you're on the latest official firmware!</strong></p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Option 3: Play on Wii Virtual Console</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>If you don't have an SD2SNES and don't want to play on emulator, it is possible to play this on the Wii
                Virtual Console.  Prior to RedGuy's recent work, this was the preferred way to play as close to original
                hardware as possible.  This requires locating a WAD file of the North American release of SMRPG on the
                Wii VC.  The randomizer can pack the generated ROM into the WAD file for you automatically.</p>
            <p>Once you have the packed WAD file, you can install it on your Wii using the Homebrew Channel.  Setting
                this up is beyong the scope of this site, but we do have some instructions on the community wiki that
                can be found
