            <p>The open mode randomizer starts off with the majority of map locations unlocked. You must find all the
                Star Pieces, guarded by random area bosses and mimic chests (and the empty space on Star Hill), to
                unlock the final dungeon and complete the game. Some boss fights are locked behind Key Items
                (progression items).</p>
            <p>Most cutscenes and text are removed. You do not do the initial version of Bowser’s Keep at the start.</p>
            <p>You start off in Mario’s Pad with 3 characters, and can recruit 2 characters by completing Forest Maze
                and Marrymore. You can use up to 3 characters in battle at a time.
            <p>This game is a platformer-rpg, and there are no random encounters. Most areas have platforming/navigation
                segments with enemies scattered throughout; collide with an enemy to start a battle or dodge them to
                progress.</p>
            <p>This guide will sometimes reference “frame windows”. SMRPG is a 60 FPS game, so a 3-frame window for
                instance would be a 1/20th of a second time interval in which an input can be accepted.</p>
            <p>You can only save your game by jumping onto a Save Box. These are available in all inns, and are also
                scattered around the world generously.</p>

                    <p>You can use EXP stars to have party members learn spells that belong to another party member's spell set. This is something of an "advanced" tech, but is good to know about.</p>
                    <p>Press X while you are jumping under an EXP star chest to hit it, and open your menu. Go to the Switch menu, and swap the character who you want to teach a spell to, with the character that already knows the spell. If the first character is about to hit the level that the second character learned the spell at, they will learn that spell during the EXP star.</p>
					<p>Example: If Mallow naturally learns Shocker at Level 10, and Peach hits level 10 during an EXP star, you can swap Peach and Mallow to have Peach learn Shocker at Level 10.</p>
					<p>This isn't often used during the randomizer as it takes some setup, but can be quite useful in the right circumstances.</p>

            <p>Battles will give you EXP, but there is a definite tradeoff between skipping fights for speed and being
                too weak to complete the final dungeon.</p>
            <p>If you have access to the factory and fast/high damage output, you can fight Ameboids before they
                multiply for ~17 exp.</p>
            <p>The game also offers invincibility stars in chests, which allow you to run around an area knocking out as
                many enemies as you can in a time limit. Every hit will give you an EXP amount determined by the chest
                itself.</p>
            <p>By default (without the EXP challenge turned on), chests generally trend toward giving you more EXP the
                further along the world map you progress. Anyone with the EXP booster equipped of course will receive 2x
                the experience from these stars.</p>
            <p>The game also has a technique called Death Abuse. When you game over, as long as you don’t reset your
                console, once you respawn at your last save, everything will be reloaded according to the state of the
                world at your last save -- except your party members will still have the levels and EXP they had when
                you died. This means you can remove all your equipment, save before a star, do the star, get into an
                encounter, intentionally lose, and respawn to do the star again, in order to farm levels. This is known
                as “Death Abusing”.</p>
            <p>At each level, your character will be granted stat bonuses. On top of that, you can choose one of three
                stat sets (attack & defense, HP, or magic attack & magic defense) to give an additional bonus to.</p>

            <p>Some equipment can only be equipped to certain characters. This can be randomized. However, you will not

                <p>The sum of your equip stats can sometimes put your character's stat below 0. This will look glitched, like Peach's Magic Defense in this screenshot:<br>
				<img alt="psych1" src="{% static 'randomizer/img/underflow.png' %}"/><br>
				Effectively, while this is supposed to convey a negative number, their stat is functionally treated as 0.</p>
            <p>While the game will tell you most of the effects that each piece of equipment has, there are some that
                have inherent special effects that are never randomized. These are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>B’tub Ring</b> - If you have this equipped, the wearer can use the Mystery Egg item 10 times to
                    obtain the Lamb’s Lure item.
                </li>
                <li><b>Coin Trick</b> - If equipped, you will receive twice the usual amount of coins in a battle.</li>
                <li><b>Exp. Booster</b> - The wearer will receive twice the stated amount of EXP from a battle.</li>
                <li><b>Jump Shoes</b> - If you have this equipped, all of the wearer’s Jump attacks bypass enemies’ Jump
                    element immunities.
                </li>
                <li><b>Scrooge Ring</b> - The wearer’s magic attacks will only use half their regular MP cost.</li>
                <li><b>Signal Ring</b> - If someone in the active party has this equipped, it will play a noise if you
                    enter a room that has an invisible chest in it.
