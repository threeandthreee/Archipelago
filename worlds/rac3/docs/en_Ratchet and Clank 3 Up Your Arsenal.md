You will be able to visit the planets with whatever post-planet you receive, receiving Post Marcadia will unlock Aquatos

and use to fire on enemy troops. Progressive upgrades will upgrade your weapons from V1 up to V5 increasing their
firepower. Receiving Inferno Mode and Jackpot Mode filler items acts like you just broke the corresponding crates.
However, receiving Inferno Mode will not change your armor, but you will still receive the full effect.
