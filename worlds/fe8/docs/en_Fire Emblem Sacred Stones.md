# Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones

## Where is the settings page?

Take a look at the options and generate a YAML [here](../player-settings).

## What does randomization do to this game?

Almost every playable unit and every enemy on every map is assigned a random
class and given a new, randomized inventory to match. Additionally, all player
units will share fixed weapon ranks across the party and are prevented from
gaining experience beyond a given level cap, both of which can be advanced by
collecting checks.

## How do I collect checks?

Currently, checks are awarded for clearing story chapters and receiving holy
weapons in cutscenes.

## What other non-randomized changes are there from vanilla FE8?

There are a few quality of life improvements meant to bring the game more
in-line with modern titles.

- Battle animations can be toggled on/off by holding L.
- Pressing Select will display the attack range of all enemies.
- Units' HP bars now display on the map.
- The UI will alert you of enemies carrying effective weapons.
- Battle statistics (damage, hit, etc) will display even with battle animations
  turned off.

## Can I play offline?

Yes, the client and connector are only necessary for sending and receiving
items. If you're playing a solo game, you don't need to play online unless you
want the rest of Archipelago's functionality (like hints and auto-tracking). If
you're playing a multiworld game, the client will sync your game with the server
the next time you connect.

## Are any modernized mechanics in this mod?

This is in the works, but will take a long time. It will require developing a
lot of new infrastructure on the modding side to selectively apply changes
according to an option.

## Is this randomizer compatible with other mods, or ROM or save editing tools?

Basic adjustments with FEBuilder should work, but installing more involved
patches may brick your ROM. We make no guarantees about patch compatibility.

Save editing will likely not work.
