# Pokémon Platinum

## Notable Differences from Base Game
* Canalave city can be accessed without first visiting Celestic town.
* The National Dex Location only requires seeing 60 Sinnoh region Pokémon.
* Sunyshore City can be accessed immediately after clearing the Distortion world.
You do not need to return to Sandgem first.
