# The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Oracle of Seasons .apworld](https://github.com/Dinopony/Archipelago/releases/latest)
- [Oracles Archipelago Patcher](https://github.com/Dinopony/oracles-archipelago-patcher/releases/latest)
- [Bizhawk 2.9.1 (x64)](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory)
- Your legally obtained Oracle of Seasons US ROM file

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the **Oracle of Seasons .apworld file** and put it inside the "lib/worlds/" subdirectory of your Archipelago install directory
2. Generate a seed using your .yaml settings file (see template below)
3. When generating, the server built for you a .patcherdata file that can be fed to the **Oracles Archipelago Patcher** software, download it
4. Download the **Oracles Archipelago Patcher** software and unzip it in its own directory
5. Put your **Oracle of Seasons US ROM** inside this folder (name doesn't matter as long as it has the .gbc file extension)
6. Get your own .patcherdata file that was generated by Archipelago Server while generating
7. Right-click the .patcherdata file, select "Open With..." and point to the **oracles-archipelago-patcher.exe** inside the same directory where you previously put the vanilla ROM
8. If everything went fine, the patched ROM should have appeared next to the .patcherdata file
9. Open the patched ROM inside Bizhawk
10. Inside Bizhawk, go into "Tools > Lua Console", then "Script > Open Script" and pick the "connector_bizhawk_generic.lua" file inside the "data/lua/" subfolder of your Archipelago install 
11. Launch Bizhawk Generic Client, it should automatically connect to the emulator
12. Connect the Client to the AP Server of your choice, and you can start playing!

## Create a Config (.yaml) File

To get the template YAML file:
1. install the .apworld file as instructed above
2. if Archipelago Launcher was running on your computer, close it 
3. run the Archipelago launcher
4. click on "Generate Template Settings"
5. it should open a directory in file explorer, pick the file named `The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Seasons.yaml`

From there, you can edit it and place it directly inside the "Players" subdirectory of your Archipelago install.
Once you have files in there, you can run ArchipelagoGenerate and play your generated multiworld!
