# The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains most of the options you need to 
configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Most acquirable pickups are shuffled among each other, following some logic to ensure the game ends up being completable.

There are a few checks still **not** being randomized:
- Maple Ghastly Doll drop (having Lon Lon Egg will always give Ghastly Doll)
- Subrosian sign-loving guy
- golden Old Man asking you to fight golden beasts 
- rare Maple drop (Piece of Heart in vanilla)
- any Gasha Seed contents

Linked games (e.g. starting a game with a code coming from Oracle of Ages) aren't supported and will most likely never be, so linked-only checks are not handled either.

## What does another world's item look like in Oracle of Seasons?

Items belonging to other worlds are currently being represented as a "galaxy blue" colored Star Ore sprite.
When collecting it, the game will inform you that you just sent an item to another player, but you need to check
on the client to see which item was actually sent.

## Changes from the vanilla game

- If enabled, you can warp to start by holding Start while exiting the map menu
