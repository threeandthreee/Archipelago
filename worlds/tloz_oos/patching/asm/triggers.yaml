# this file is for removal of triggers that would arbitrarily restrict the
# game, and in some cases even cause softlocks. essences are the biggest
# culprit, but there are some other weird things, like not/having a certain
# item or not/having a certain global flag set (that wouldn't logically cause
# whatever event that it causes).

# initiate all these events without requiring essences:

0a/4bf4/: cp $00    # ^

09/4e36/: jp $4eab  # spawn moosh
0f/7428/: jr nz,$00 # ^

09/4e40/: or $57  # spawn dimitri

09/4e72/: or $4f  # spawn ricky

# Dimitri doesn't spawn in vanilla if you have flippers.
