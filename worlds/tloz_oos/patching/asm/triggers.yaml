# this file is for removal of triggers that would arbitrarily restrict the
# game, and in some cases even cause softlocks. essences are the biggest
# culprit, but there are some other weird things, like not/having a certain
# item or not/having a certain global flag set (that wouldn't logically cause
# whatever event that it causes).

# initiate all these events without requiring essences:
