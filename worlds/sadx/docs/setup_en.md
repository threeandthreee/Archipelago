2. Install SA Mod Manager as per [its instructions in GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/15436)

   button.
2. For the `Server IP` field under `AP Settings`, enter the address of the server, such as archipelago.gg:54321, your
   server host should be able to tell you this.
3. For the `PlayerName` field under `AP Settings`, enter your "name" field from the yaml, or website config.
4. For the `Password` field under `AP Settings`, enter the server password if one exists, otherwise leave blank.
5. Click The `Save` button then hit `Save & Play` to launch the game.

## Troubleshooting

- You get the SADX_Archipelago: DLL error - The specified module could not be found.
    - Make sure that the antivirus didn't delete the `/mods/SADX_Archipelago/sadx-classic-randomizer.dll` file.
- The game closes when you press start.
    - This is a steam input issue. Either run the game from steam or adjust the "Desktop controller configuration" to
      just be a controller.
    - You can also just simple close steam
- Some of the emblems don't give me checks
    - Disable the "Steam Achievements Mod" if enabled
- Some checks or elements of the randomizer are missing
    - Disable the "Fixes, Adds, and Beta Restores" if enabled
- Failed to generate the world
    - Try updating your Archipelago mod to the latest version (at least 0.5.0)
    - Try enabling more options in the yaml, being too restrictive will prevent the world from generation
