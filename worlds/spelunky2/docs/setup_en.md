# Spelunky 2

## Required Software
- Download the latest version of the Spelunky 2 apworld [here] https://github.com/Eszenn/Archipelago/releases/tag/Spelunky2v0.1.0/
- Download the latest lua54.7z [here] https://github.com/black-sliver/lua-apclientpp/releases
- Download the latest version of Modlunky 2 [here]https://github.com/spelunky-fyi/modlunky2/releases/latest, and make sure you are using the nightly version
- Download the latest version of the mod using Modlunky to automatically install it to your mods folder, or download the mod [here]https://spelunky.fyi/mods/m/spelunky-2-archipelago/ and extract the contents of the .zip file to Mods/Packs in your Spelunky 2 installation

## Installation  
1. Double click the installed apworld to automatically install it to Archipelago, or manually move the file into the custom_worlds folder in your Archipelago installation
2. Copy the contents of the lua54-clang64-static folder to your Spelunky 2 installation folder
3. Navigate to the Playlunky tab in Modlunky 2, toggle "Archipelago" and click "Play!"
- It is HIGHLY recommended to turn on the "Use Playlunky Save" in the options menu! This mod frequently overwrites the save used by the game, and while it does make backups, errors can occur. I cannot be held liable if you lose your save file while using this mod.
4. Once on the main menu, you will need to enable the mod manually, as it requires unsafe mode to load the library used to connect to Archipelago
5. Enter your slot name, the server address, and password (if applicable) in the popup menu and click connect to connect to Archipelago
- If you receive a message saying "Socket Error: invalid http status", restart your game. I don't know why this happens, but restarting the game usually fixes it
6. Once you see a message saying "Slot Connected" in the top left, you are connected to Archipelago and ready to begin playing!
