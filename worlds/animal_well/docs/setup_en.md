# ANIMAL WELL Setup Guide

## Required Software
- [ANIMAL WELL](https://www.animalwell.net/) for PC
- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest)

## Optional Software
- [Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases/latest)

## Configure Archipelago Options

### Configure Your YAML File and Generate a Randomized Game
Note: You will need to use Archipelago version 0.5.0. You can find the Release Candidate pinned in the ap-core-dev chat in the Discord. If you want to host it on the website, you must use the archipelago.gg:24242 website.

Place the `animal_well.apworld` in your `Archipelago/lib/worlds` folder.
Open up the Archipelago Launcher.
Click on Generate Template Options.
Grab the `ANIMAL WELL.yaml` file and place it in your `Archipelago/Players` folder, and customize it to your liking.
Place any other yamls you would like to generate in this folder as well.
Run `Generate` from the Archipelago Launcher.
Upload your generated game (in you `Archipelago/output` folder) at the [Archipelago Uploads page](https://archipelago.gg/uploads), or host locally.

## Play the Randomized Game
1. Launch ANIMAL WELL, and start a new game on an empty save file (or continue from your previous save file that you used for this Archipelago session). Be sure to use either file 2 or file 3, do not use file 1.
2. Open up the Archipelago Launcher, and click on ANIMAL WELL Client. Do not open up the ANIMAL WELL Client before doing the previous step.
3. Wait patiently for up to 1 minute for it to properly detect your game and find the information it needs to modify it. If it takes more than a minute, try closing and reopening both the game and the client.
4. Connect to the server and start playing.

## Notes
- This is in early Alpha. If you encounter bugs, please report them in the ANIMAL WELL Future Game Design post in the Archipelago discord.
- When you pick up an item from a chest, it will show the vanilla item. See the ANIMAL WELL Client to see what item you actually found in the chest. Sometimes, this will affect your currently equipped item. Open the inventory to manually select a different item if this happens.
- There are some options missing. This is known, and they will be made available as we get them to function.
- See the [ANIMAL WELL Game Info Page](https://github.com/ScipioWright/Archipelago-SW/blob/animal-well/worlds/animal_well/docs/en_ANIMAL%20WELL.md) for more information.
