## Configure Archipelago Options

### Configure Your YAML File and Generate a Randomized Game
Note: You will need to use Archipelago version 0.5.0.

- Place the `animal_well.apworld` in your `Archipelago/custom_worlds` folder.
- Open up the Archipelago Launcher.
- Click on Generate Template Options.
- Grab the `ANIMAL WELL.yaml` file and place it in your `Archipelago/Players` folder, and customize it to your liking.
- Place any other yamls you would like to generate in this folder as well.
- Run `Generate` from the Archipelago Launcher.
- Upload your generated game (in you `Archipelago/output` folder) at the [Archipelago Uploads page](https://archipelago.gg/uploads), or host locally.

## Play the Randomized Game
1. Launch ANIMAL WELL, and start a new game on an empty save file (or continue from your previous save file that you used for this Archipelago session).
2. Open up the Archipelago Launcher, and click on ANIMAL WELL Client. Do not open up the ANIMAL WELL Client before doing the previous step.
3. Connect to the server and start playing.

## Notes
- There are some options missing. This is known, and they will be made available as we get them to function.
