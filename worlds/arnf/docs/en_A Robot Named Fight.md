# A Robot Named Fight

## Where is the settings page?
The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
It's a rogue-like that is already randomized, but the Archipelago causes those items to then be scattered across other worlds.


## What is the goal of ARNF in Archipelago?
There can be multiple goals.  Based on the selected options, you might need to only perform a "Classic Boss Rush", or you might
need to complete every available game mode.


## What ARNF items can appear in other players' worlds?
Any non-progression item can be found in other worlds and sent to ARNF.  If a new game is started while connected to the server
(whether due to death or otherwise), Fight will be given relevant items from the new run based on what has previously been collected.


### How many items are there?
Each game mode that is enabled in the player options has a different number of items that can be found in them.  Currently supporter:
- Normal: 36 locations/items
- Classic Boss Rush: 13 locations/items


## What does another world's item look like in ARNF?
Unfortunately, I have not yet figured out how to replace the icons, so every item you find in ARNF will look like it normally would,
but picking any non-progression item up will always send a check to the server instead of granting it to Fight.
