# Majora's Mask Recompiled

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page](../player-options) for this game contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All main inventory items, dungeon chests, heart pieces, stray fairies, and gold skulltula houses currently get shuffled.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. It is possible to choose to limit certain items to your own world.

## What does another world's item look like in MM?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by the Archipelago logo with several variations depending on item importance.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, it'll be added to your inventory without interruption. This isn't show-and-tell.
