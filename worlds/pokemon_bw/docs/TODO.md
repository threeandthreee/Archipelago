# Single reports, cannot recreate, need to wait for more reports

- not receiving key items?
- scientist nathan no text after battle?
- ranger claude talking french after battle?
- Some hidden items are not checkable immediately?
- grunt in pinwheel forest with vanilla dragon skull not talking anymore after obtaining the dragon skull
- stone grunts not disappearing?
- sequence break problem with npcs not moving, see channel
- incredibly low catch chances? idk how that could be related to the apworld in any way
- plando items having issues? plandoing basic badge into abyssal ruins sometimes raises fillerrors about this item not being placeable
- route 8 bianca items logic, apparently said to be in logic without light/dark stone, but blocked by grunts wanting the stone
