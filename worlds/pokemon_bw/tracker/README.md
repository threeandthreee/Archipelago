Dear whoever is reading this,

I am palex00. I am / was the project manager™ of the team that created this UT tracker integration.
The team consisted of me, RadisNoir, DarkFire and Darvitz.

This file exists to let you know that you are free to use all files of the tracker folder (images, code, etc.)
if you wish to make a GOOD poptracker pack. Note: it has to be good. You have to put effort in. I am willing
to show you how you can improve things. But we won't accept halfassery. Anyways. Good luck.

TL;DR: You can use the images & files from this repo for your (good) poptracker pack
