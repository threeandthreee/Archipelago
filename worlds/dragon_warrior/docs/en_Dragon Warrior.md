# Dragon Warrior

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What is the goal of Dragon Warrior when randomized?

The goal is to defeat the Dragonlord in Charlock. To do so, the player must acquire the Rainbow Drop to create the bridge. This is technically the
only "hard" requirement, however equipment is also shuffled around as progressive upgrades which may be necessary as well.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All items contained in chests, search spots, and shops are shuffled around.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any shuffled item can be in other players' worlds.
