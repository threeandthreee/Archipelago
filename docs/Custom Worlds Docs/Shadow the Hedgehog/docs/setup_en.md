## Generating and Patching a Game

1. Create your options file (YAML). For now, this does not have any game settings, but will in future.
2. Follow the general Archipelago instructions for [generating a game](../../Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game).
3. Open `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe`
4. Select 'Shadow The Hedgehog Client.'
5. Ensure the lib folder contains the python dolphin memory engine.
6. Open Dolphin and open the game.
7. Enter your credentials.

You must remain with client running whenever playing the game to receive checks and other items.
You should now be able to receive and send items. You'll need to do these steps every time you want to reconnect.
