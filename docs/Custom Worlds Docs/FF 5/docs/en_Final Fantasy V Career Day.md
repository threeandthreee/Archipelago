# Final Fantasy V Career Day

## What is Final Fantasy V Career Day? 

Final Fantasy V Career Day is a randomized version of FFV that abstracts progress in the game. The player starts with an 
airship, and has the ability to check many locations immediately. Cutscenes are largely removed from the game. The
player is given a WarpShard, which allows access to the different worlds of FFV. Depending on the settings chosen, 
worlds are unlocked at different checkpoints.

You can find [a wiki for FFVCD here](https://www.bigbridge.studio/cdwiki/doku.php). Note that this wiki is not 
specifically for multiworld, but will contain many pertinent details. 

## Game Progression

The goal of the game is to defeat Exdeath in World 3. In order to do that, there are a few critical key items:

- The Adamantite key item permits access to World 2 via the WarpShard
- The Anti-Barrier and Bracelet key items permit access to Exdeath's Castle in World 2
- Defeating Exdeath in World 2 unlocks access to World 3 via the WarpShard
- The Rift is immediately available in World 3. In order to progress to the end of the Rift,
4 tablets must be acquired. 
- After 4 Tablets are acquired, Exdeath can be fought in World 3.

There are many other key items. For example, one of the required Tablets may be placed in the Great Trench.
The Great Trench requires World 3 access, the Submarine Key to use the submarine function of the ship,
and the Trench Page to allow access to the dungeon.

Under the default "Bosses" setting for Progression Checks, only bosses can award 
progression related checks for either the player's seed, or for other players' multiworlds. 
All other chests & events provide anything from helpful to filler rewards. 

However, playing with "All" for Progression Checks means that every event & chest can have
progression related checks. To obtain a full list of checks, generate a test multiworld and
review the full list of checks in the spoiler log under the FFVCD section. 

A basic strategy for FFVCD is to look at the below list of bosses, and attempt to clear
the ones with the lowest HP locations first. Then, as your party powers up and receives
more key items, more boss locations will be able to be checked.

## Key Items

The default setting for FFVCD in Archipelago is "World 1 (W1) lock", which means that the player is locked in
World 1 until Worlds 2 & 3 are unlocked.

## Reward Placement

Besides the bosses mentioned above, all other locations for finding items are either chests or events. You can generate
a test seed and review all of these in the spoiler log. Each seed will generate the following and send across the multi-
world:

- All individual Job Crystals 
- All individual magic spells (all types in the magic menu) 
- All job abilities. Each ability is learned for each party member (e.g., finding Summon Lv3 adds it to everyone)
- Depending on how many item slots are left, regular items will be drawn, including consumable items, weapons, armor, and accessories

If playing with the four job mode, Crystals and Abilities will not be placed. 

## Hints

Various NPCs in the game will give you hints about where randomly selected items are in the multiworld.

## Trapped Chests

If the Trapped Chests setting is enabled, 30 chests throughout the chosen FFVCD's world will be chosen. These chests
will have high value items local to this world. 10 random encounters from the game will be placed at these chests,
and which are decided from a ranking system - generally the later in the vanilla game, the higher the threat of each
chest. Most Trapped Chests can be fled from, and the fight can be reattempted. Trapped Chests will not contain progression.


## Other information

Some locations in the base game that would be missable are designed to be re-checkable. For example, 
all of the Karnak escape sequence can be re-triggered by re-entering the Steamship after completing
the first Karnak escape.

## Where is the settings page?

The settings page [can be found here](../player-settings).

## When does a player receive items?

Generally players will receive items as they are collected by other worlds. There are three places where items
arent't collected and temporarily paused:

- While in a menu (specifically when the screen is not dimmed after a transition)
- While in battle
- While on the title screen and not yet in a loaded game
