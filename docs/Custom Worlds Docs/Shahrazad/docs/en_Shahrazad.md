# Shahrazad

## What does randomization do to this game?

This is a standalone game.  
All it does, is take a pre-existing AP game, and places a logic requirement to reach its Menu location on an item.  
This item is shuffled and the game cannot be played until you receive this item.   
When you make a YAML, you can add as many Scheherazade games as you want but at least one game logically has to be open.


## What is the goal of this game when randomized?

The goal is to unlock all the locked games in order to complete their goals.

## Which of my items can be in another player's world?

An item that is named "[game slot name] start" will be randomly distributed amongst the other player's worlds. There will be exactly 1 of these items per "locked" game.
