Starting with 13.0.0:
- I aim to maintain client compatibility across major versions (first number). If you already have a patched game, you should be able to update and keep playing it as long as the major version is the same.
- I aim to maintain patch compatibility across minor versions (second number). If you already have a generate game, you should be able to update and use the same patch file as long as minor version is the same.
- Patch versions (third number) might break YAMLs.
